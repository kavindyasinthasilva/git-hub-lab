What is GitHub?
Exploring a GitHub repository
Using issues
This is an issue ðŸ“–: a place where you can have conversations about bugs in your code, code review, and just about anything else.

Issue titles are like email subject lines. They tell your collaborators what the issue is about at a glance. For example, the title of this issue is Getting Started with GitHub.
