Welcome to kavindu yasintha silva üéâ!

If you're new to GitHub Pages, or you want to learn how to build and host a GitHub Pages site, you're in the right place. With GitHub Pages, you can host content like documentation, resumes, or any other static content that you‚Äôd like.

In this course, you'll create a blog hosted on GitHub Pages and learn how to:

Enable GitHub Pages
Use sky, a static site generator
Customize sky sites with a theme and content
New to GitHub?
For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the the Introduction to GitHub course.

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Generate a GitHub Pages site
The first step to publishing your blog to the web is to enable GitHub Pages on this repository üìñ. When you enable GitHub Pages on a repository, GitHub takes the content that's on the master branch and publishes a website based on its contents.

Under your repository name, click Settings.
In the "GitHub Pages" section, in the Source drop-down, select master branch.
After GitHub Pages is enabled and the site is started, we'll be ready to create some more content.

Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. I may take up to a minute to respond as I await the deployment.


Step 2: Customize your homepage


You can customize your homepage by adding content to either an index file or the README.md file. GitHub Pages first looks for an index file. If an index file is found, GitHub Pages uses the content in the file to create the homepage. If an index file isn‚Äôt found, it uses the README.md to create the homepage.

Your repository has an index.md file so we can update it to include your personalized content.

‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Create your homepage
Navigate to the Code tab of this repository, and browse to the index.md file, or click this link here
In the upper right corner, click the the icon to the right of the file to edit the index.md file
Type the content you want on your homepage
Scroll to the bottom, type a commit message, and click Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
Open a pull request
Once you have created your pull request, I will move over there to discuss next steps.
